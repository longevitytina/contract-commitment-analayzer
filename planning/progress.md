<!-- write everything we did so far, ensure to note the approach we're taking, the steps we've done so far, and the current failure that we're working on. Also note the assumptions we've made and the decisions we've made. Also note the progress we've made so far. -->



<!-- component usage flow -->


<!-- modal path (working) -->


<!-- Message stream path (broken) -->


<!-- code references -->
<!-- path to file: line number -->

 <!-- optimize for correctness, completeness, trajectory, and size -->

<!-- Three phases of development -->
<!-- 1. Research -->
<!-- 1.1. Understand the project -->
<!-- 1.2. Understand the data -->
<!-- 1.3. Understand the requirements -->
<!-- 1.4. Understand the constraints -->
<!-- 1.5. Understand the dependencies -->
<!-- 1.6. Understand the alternatives -->
<!-- 1.7. Understand the tradeoffs -->
<!-- 1.8. Understand the risks -->
<!-- 2. Planning -->
<!-- 2.1 outline the exact implementation steps - include filenames, lines, snippets, etc. -->
<!-- 2.2. Be explicit about testing steps -->
<!-- 3. Implementation - Go write the code -->
